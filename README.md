# Portfolio

This GitHub Repo holds my portfolio page.

Originally, I created a portfolio page for the FreeCodeCamp curriculum on codepen.io. I will port that over to github, update it, and host it via github pages.

## TO DO:
- [ ] Convert bootstrap styling to CSS Grid (learning exercise)
- [ ] Fix scroll spy / navbar tracking issues. Worked in Codepen...
- [ ] Add remaining FCC completed projects and thumbnails to portfolio.
- [ ] Really need a better background
